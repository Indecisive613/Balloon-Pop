# Balloon-Pop

##Overview
Balloon Pop is a simple game where users click on balloons in order to pop them. The balloons move at various speeds across the screen, and come in a variety of colours and sizes. When a balloon reaches the edge of the space, it bounces back and heads in a new direction. As the player pops balloons, new balloons will appear on the screen. The balloons do not bounce off each other, rather they pass each other at different depths. Here is a screenshot of the game in action:

## Languages  
This program uses Java and the PApplet class from the processing library.
