# Balloon-Pop

## Overview
Balloon Pop is a simple game where users click on balloons in order to pop them. The balloons move randomly across the screen at varying speeds. The balloons come in a variety of colours and sizes. When a balloon reaches the edge of the space, it bounces back and heads in a new direction. The balloons do not bounce off each other; instead they pass each other. As the player pops balloons, new balloons with a randomized colour, size, direction and speed will appear on the screen. Here is a screenshot of the game in action:
